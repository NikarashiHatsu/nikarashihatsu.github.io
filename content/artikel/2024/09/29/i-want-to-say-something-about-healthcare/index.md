Healthcare, yeah, a field we should really need whether when we're sick, or healthy by doing a medical checkup. It's a field that I don't really master, but I put an eye into it for quite a while. On a side note, healthcare is very expensive unless you have an insurance, and by that, I want to talk quite a bit about what's happening with this field in my city.

## A Brief Introduction

So, what really happening here, exactly? Pretty much, in general, our healthcare are divided into two types of category: The People **who have insurance** (any), and the People **who doesn't have any insurance**. Insurance, to me, is more like a "subscription-based" real life feature, which gives you a privilege to get a cheaper medication option to even get a "free" one. Yet, there's a lot of catches. For those people who doesn't have any insurance, they will end up into these scenario:

- They survive longer, because they got better medication, but also rich as hell
- They're getting broke in such sort time
- They won't even survive a day of life-threatening cases

In my opinion, there are some cases where you want to have a better, non-insurance medication provided.

1. You have a life-threatening situation where you need an urgent medication
2. You have a long-term sickness that degenerates your health quality
3. You have a lot of money (obviously)


### Why Insurance is Matter Within Our City

Even though I always talk trash about insurance, the fact that it helps a lot of middle-lower class citizens, it's a good piece of paper that can be stashed inside your pocket. In context, the city I live in is mostly inhabited with lower-class citizens with an average annual earnings of USD $2K. Most of them are paid lower because statistically it's a big city, with most of it are poor districts.

Our national health insurance company, BPJS is one of the subsidized insurance that provided by government. Most of the people who have a job will likely got their salary cut by a small amount of percentage by this insurance, the cut percentage is based on what job they have. By 2023, they have 3 classes: the 1st class is about $10, 2nd class is about $6.6, and 3rd class is about $2.3, people who have this insurance have to pay it monthly. This policy, however, changed in 2024 where those classification are deprecated and changed by specific profession that person have, generally, they will be charged 5% of their monthly salary. Yet, the policy can be dynamically changed by the company.


## The Current, Standard Healthcare

In this city, healthcares / medications are easily accessible, by 10 minutes walk or 3 minutes ride to local community healthcares or clinics, all of them are accepting BPJS. Hospital however, are pretty far, but accepting wide-range of insurances so they can treat you better if you have a better insurance.

Talking about quality, I do really appreciate the works of all doctors who worked really hard to diagnose, prescribe, and treat us. But really, you will be treat differently based on what class of insurance you have.

Before you continue reading, I want to remind you again that this section is purely biased based on my experience, a friend of mine, and a relative of mine. Feel free to accept / denying facts I write here.


### Insurance sucks: No boundary, virtually can't be seen

Few weeks ago, I had this terrible pain around my neck, it's really stiff and makes me hurt to turn around my head. Since I occassionally have a terrible sleep position, I do blame it and rest if a day. Turns out, its getting worse and it affect my productivity, so I contacted my family's personal doctor to diagnose and prescribe the correct medication. The diagnose was that my nervous system is pressured, so he prescribes two different drugs, mainly to easy the pain, and a vitamin to improve the nervous system health. A week passed and the pain still persists. So I went to a local clinic which I believed, it will ease up my pain.

Before the diagnostic, I have to register myself to be diagnosed. It was 9AM, the clinic was still empty. But, the diagnostic department started at 1PM, so in the meantime, I have a quick rest. Fast forward, I readminister myself and got into a situation where my insurance is denied. The reason was simple: it's inactive. I got this big question of "Why?", if my father still paying for my insurance, why it was inactive? Until this date, I haven't found the right answer on how or why my insurance is cancelled. So, judging by the amount of pain I had that "alright, I don't care of how much I'll pay" moment.

The administration itself costs me $2. Pretty cheap in USD, but hefty one, just for an administration. The wait time is around 45 minutes, in the waiting room I had to endure immense sharp pain that keeps throbbing around my neck. Life's really sucks at this point. My pain virtually gone by the time I got called, I don't know how my brain works, but sudden endorphins or adrenaline might took effect.
