  "articleBody": " Photo by Ales Nesetril on Unsplash\nThe words of description above are insults thrown at me by my friends and even some of my family members. They say things like, ‚ÄúWhy did you buy such an expensive laptop? It‚Äôs just for coding anyway.‚Äù\nMy initial reaction was anger, and I now tend to avoid people who say such things. To others, a laptop may only be a device that supports the needs of office workers, students, or heavy gamers.\nMy reason for being upset is understandable because my main use for the laptop is for work. As a programmer, a Personal Computer, whether it‚Äôs a laptop, desktop, or AIO, will be used fully from morning to night (even 24 hours if there is a deadline).\nBut the fact that I spent a significant amount of money on a MacBook can‚Äôt be denied, and I carry this laptop in my bag every day, so however angry I may be, I have to accept it.\nAlthough it was a blind buy at first, after a year of using it, I feel a very big difference in several aspects compared to a normal laptop. The reasons are varied.\nLoad Time Photo by Clint Patterson on Unsplash\n‚ÄúLoad Time‚Äù refers to how long it takes for a device to complete a task. For example, when opening a browser, such as Google Chrome, we wait a few seconds after clicking the browser icon. The amount of time we wait for Google Chrome to open is called the Load Time.\nThe same goes for games, whether it‚Äôs opening a new area, transitioning to a room, or before fighting the final boss, there will be a loading time before we can carry out our next activity.\nOf course, coding also requires a fast Load Time. I‚Äôve heard some complaints from other programmer friends, even fellow computer engineering students:\nYou know, I wait so long for loading, I can eat or snack while waiting. Or even have a poo. It‚Äôs so slow! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\nOr even worse:\nGhits, I once waited for Flutter to install, it was so slow, I started playing with my phone while waiting. But when I was playing with my phone, I lost track of time and suddenly it was night.\nWow. But in this case, we can‚Äôt entirely blame the Load Time, because the main cause of slow Load Time is the inability of the processor or RAM to process and allocate data received. Of course, the speed of the HDD / SSD also matters.\nI personally have experience benchmarking my MacBook Pro M1 2020 with my old ASUS X441UV laptop. To open a Flutter project, until it‚Äôs running, the Load Time difference is drastic.\nDevice Running Time MacBook Pro M1 2020 24s ASUS X441UV 1m 12s So, in conclusion, by eliminating Load Time, we as developers can focus on other more important things, such as thinking about the logic of the system being built. Eliminating Load Time also results in longer productive time.\nBattery Life Photo by Panos Sakalakis on Unsplash\nBasically, laptops can be taken anywhere without worrying about not having an electrical outlet. The main problem with laptops now is battery issues. Laptops in general have a battery cycle that will decrease with usage. In my case with my ASUS laptop, the laptop could last without charging in the first year. The second year, it began to drop, and had to be charged to full capacity in the third month.\nThere are three options I can do:\nThe cheapest option, keep it plugged in, the risk is if it is suddenly disconnected or the power goes out. Rather-expensive option, replace the battery. The expensive option, replace the laptop. At that time, as a high school student, I did not have the money to buy a battery. So I took the first option. Actually, the risk is high, if during a Windows Update, the power is disconnected, there is a possibility that the Windows will become corrupted. Or while gaming or designing, there is a possibility that the progress data will be lost.\nToday, when this blog is written, my MacBook is over 1 year old, and its battery life is still at 87%. It can still survive a full day under heavy workload.\nBattery health from 100% to 87% in one year is considered wasteful due to a small mistake I made, I installed the Intel version of VSCode while my MacBook uses the ARM architecture. Of course, at that time, there was a battery drain from 100% to 20% in 2 hours. Very wasteful.\nPerformance Photo from Tekno Cerdas.\nWho would have thought that Apple Silicon could surpass the performance of the latest and strongest Intel processors? According to Techjourneyman, when the Apple Silicon M1 was released, it outperformed the best generation 10 Intel processor (i9-10980HK), forcing Intel to fight back.\nOf course, Intel beat M1 with the release of the i9-11900K, but was completely defeated by the M1 Max and M1 Ultra. In terms of performance and integrated GPU, M1 is far ahead of Intel, who relies on external GPUs like Nvidia.\n‚ÄúWith such great performance and power, what about battery usage, is it wasteful?‚Äù No, because the M1 architecture is ARM-based, focusing on the balance between processor size, lower power consumption, lower heat, speed, and longer battery life. Unlike processors with x86 architecture, which optimize performance but consume a lot of power.\nDisadvantages It‚Äôs not fair if I only state the advantages of the MacBook while not mentioning its disadvantages. Of course, these things I felt have a significant impact on me:\nA steep learning curve. As a new MacBook user, MacOS has many features that rely on shortcuts if you want to work faster. Moreover, the difference in UI from Windows to MacOS is very different.\nNot modular, once you buy a MacBook, there are no options to upgrade it in terms of storage, RAM, or processor. Yes, all components are soldered to the motherboard.\nWindows applications cannot be installed on MacOS. Although some developers can bring their applications to MacOS, most cannot be installed just like that. The solution is, you can use the web version of the application or install it on a virtual machine like Parallels.\nFeatures that have been available on Windows for a long time are not yet available on MacOS. A feature that I often need on Windows is the volume mixer. A simple software aimed at adjusting the sound of each application is not provided on MacOS. Whether in the development stage, or Apple deliberately does not make it.\nCapitalism at its best. Many paid programs are overpriced, even for extending iCloud storage, we have to pay a subscription. Every Apple built-in feature such as Music, TV, Podcasts is all paid.\nPorts. MacBook releases in 2020 and above, with the 13-inch series, do not have enough ports for everyday needs. Only 2 thunderbolt type C ports are provided by Apple, and there are no other ports. So I have to buy a dongle, which is not cheap either.\nLast words Aside from the luxurious presentation of the Apple logo, there are many advantages to the MacBook that I have experienced. But is the MacBook ‚Äúworth to buy‚Äù? Honestly, no. Personally, I prefer Linux, with its optimized performance (although complicated), you can get performance comparable to a MacBook or even better by using Linux without spending tens of millions of budgets.\nI can even say that my ASUS X441UV laptop almost reached the performance of the MacBook M1 for basic daily usage when using Arch Linux. So, for those of you who want to buy Apple products, reconsider your budget, okay üò¨.\n",

<p>I personally have experience benchmarking my MacBook Pro M1 2020 with my old
ASUS X441UV laptop. To open a Flutter project, until it&rsquo;s running, the Load Time
difference is drastic.</p>

<p>So, in conclusion, by eliminating Load Time, we as developers can focus on other
more important things, such as thinking about the logic of the system being
built. Eliminating Load Time also results in longer productive time.</p>

<p>Basically, laptops can be taken anywhere without worrying about not having an
electrical outlet. The main problem with laptops now is battery issues. Laptops
in general have a battery cycle that will decrease with usage. In my case with
my ASUS laptop, the laptop could last without charging in the first year. The
second year, it began to drop, and had to be charged to full capacity in the
third month.</p>
<p>There are three options I can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>The cheapest option, keep it plugged in, the risk is if it is suddenly disconnected or the power goes out.</li>
<li>Rather-expensive option, replace the battery.</li>
<li>The expensive option, replace the laptop.</li>
</ol>
<p>At that time, as a high school student, I did not have the money to buy a
battery. So I took the first option. Actually, the risk is high, if during a
Windows Update, the power is disconnected, there is a possibility that the
Windows will become corrupted. Or while gaming or designing, there is a
possibility that the progress data will be lost.</p>
<p>Today, when this blog is written, my MacBook is over 1 year old, and its battery
life is still at 87%. It can still survive a full day under heavy workload.</p>
<p>Battery health from 100% to 87% in one year is considered wasteful due to a
small mistake I made, I installed the Intel version of VSCode while my MacBook
uses the ARM architecture. Of course, at that time, there was a battery drain
from 100% to 20% in 2 hours. Very wasteful.</p>
<h2 id="performance">Performance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#performance">#</a></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/article/macbook-fashionable-or-actually-impressive/apple-silicon.jpg" alt="Apple Silicon"  />
</p>
<p>Photo from <a href="https://teknocerdas.com/berita/chip-m1-apple-silicon-pada-macbook-air-mengalahkan-macbook-pro/">Tekno Cerdas</a>.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that Apple Silicon could surpass the performance of the
latest and strongest Intel processors? According to <a href="https://techjourneyman.com/blog/apple-silicon-evolution-vs-intel-and-amd/">Techjourneyman</a>, when the
Apple Silicon M1 was released, it outperformed the best generation 10 Intel
processor (i9-10980HK), forcing Intel to fight back.</p>
<p>Of course, Intel beat M1 with the release of the i9-11900K, but was completely
defeated by the M1 Max and M1 Ultra. In terms of performance and integrated GPU,
M1 is far ahead of Intel, who relies on external GPUs like Nvidia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With such great performance and power, what about battery usage, is it
wasteful?&rdquo; No, because the M1 architecture is ARM-based, focusing on the balance
between processor size, lower power consumption, lower heat, speed, and longer
battery life. Unlike processors with x86 architecture, which optimize
performance but consume a lot of power.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#disadvantages">#</a></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not fair if I only state the advantages of the MacBook while not mentioning
its disadvantages. Of course, these things I felt have a significant impact on
me:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A steep learning curve. As a new MacBook user, MacOS has many features that
rely on shortcuts if you want to work faster. Moreover, the difference in UI
from Windows to MacOS is very different.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not modular, once you buy a MacBook, there are no options to upgrade it in
terms of storage, RAM, or processor. Yes, all components are soldered to the
motherboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Windows applications cannot be installed on MacOS. Although some developers
can bring their applications to MacOS, most cannot be installed just like
that. The solution is, you can use the web version of the application or
install it on a virtual machine like Parallels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Features that have been available on Windows for a long time are not yet
available on MacOS. A feature that I often need on Windows is the volume
mixer. A simple software aimed at adjusting the sound of each application is
not provided on MacOS. Whether in the development stage, or Apple
deliberately does not make it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capitalism at its best. Many paid programs are overpriced, even for extending
iCloud storage, we have to pay a subscription. Every Apple built-in feature
such as Music, TV, Podcasts is all paid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ports. MacBook releases in 2020 and above, with the 13-inch series, do not
have enough ports for everyday needs. Only 2 thunderbolt type C ports are
provided by Apple, and there are no other ports. So I have to buy a dongle,
which is not cheap either.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="last-words">Last words<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#last-words">#</a></h2>
<p>Aside from the luxurious presentation of the Apple logo, there are many
advantages to the MacBook that I have experienced. But is the MacBook &ldquo;worth to
buy&rdquo;? Honestly, no. Personally, I prefer Linux, with its optimized performance
(although complicated), you can get performance comparable to a MacBook or even
better by using Linux without spending tens of millions of budgets.</p>
<p>I can even say that my ASUS X441UV laptop almost reached the performance of the
MacBook M1 for basic daily usage when using Arch Linux. So, for those of you who
want to buy Apple products, reconsider your budget, okay üò¨.</p>
