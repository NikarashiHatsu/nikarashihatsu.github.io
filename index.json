[{"content":" Photo by Ales Nesetril on Unsplash\nThe words of description above are insults thrown at me by my friends and even some of my family members. They say things like, \u0026ldquo;Why did you buy such an expensive laptop? It\u0026rsquo;s just for coding anyway.\u0026rdquo;\nMy initial reaction was anger, and I now tend to avoid people who say such things. To others, a laptop may only be a device that supports the needs of office workers, students, or heavy gamers.\nMy reason for being upset is understandable because my main use for the laptop is for work. As a programmer, a Personal Computer, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a laptop, desktop, or AIO, will be used fully from morning to night (even 24 hours if there is a deadline).\nBut the fact that I spent a significant amount of money on a MacBook can\u0026rsquo;t be denied, and I carry this laptop in my bag every day, so however angry I may be, I have to accept it.\nAlthough it was a blind buy at first, after a year of using it, I feel a very big difference in several aspects compared to a normal laptop. The reasons are varied.\nLoad Time Photo by Clint Patterson on Unsplash\n\u0026ldquo;Load Time\u0026rdquo; refers to how long it takes for a device to complete a task. For example, when opening a browser, such as Google Chrome, we wait a few seconds after clicking the browser icon. The amount of time we wait for Google Chrome to open is called the Load Time.\nThe same goes for games, whether it\u0026rsquo;s opening a new area, transitioning to a room, or before fighting the final boss, there will be a loading time before we can carry out our next activity.\nOf course, coding also requires a fast Load Time. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard some complaints from other programmer friends, even fellow computer engineering students:\nYou know, I wait so long for loading, I can eat or snack while waiting. Or even have a poo. It\u0026rsquo;s so slow! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\nOr even worse:\nGhits, I once waited for Flutter to install, it was so slow, I started playing with my phone while waiting. But when I was playing with my phone, I lost track of time and suddenly it was night.\nWow. But in this case, we can\u0026rsquo;t entirely blame the Load Time, because the main cause of slow Load Time is the inability of the processor or RAM to process and allocate data received. Of course, the speed of the HDD / SSD also matters.\nI personally have experience benchmarking my MacBook Pro M1 2020 with my old ASUS X441UV laptop. To open a Flutter project, until it\u0026rsquo;s running, the Load Time difference is drastic.\nDevice Running Time MacBook Pro M1 2020 24s ASUS X441UV 1m 12s So, in conclusion, by eliminating Load Time, we as developers can focus on other more important things, such as thinking about the logic of the system being built. Eliminating Load Time also results in longer productive time.\nBattery Life Photo by Panos Sakalakis on Unsplash\nBasically, laptops can be taken anywhere without worrying about not having an electrical outlet. The main problem with laptops now is battery issues. Laptops in general have a battery cycle that will decrease with usage. In my case with my ASUS laptop, the laptop could last without charging in the first year. The second year, it began to drop, and had to be charged to full capacity in the third month.\nThere are three options I can do:\nThe cheapest option, keep it plugged in, the risk is if it is suddenly disconnected or the power goes out. Rather-expensive option, replace the battery. The expensive option, replace the laptop. At that time, as a high school student, I did not have the money to buy a battery. So I took the first option. Actually, the risk is high, if during a Windows Update, the power is disconnected, there is a possibility that the Windows will become corrupted. Or while gaming or designing, there is a possibility that the progress data will be lost.\nToday, when this blog is written, my MacBook is over 1 year old, and its battery life is still at 87%. It can still survive a full day under heavy workload.\nBattery health from 100% to 87% in one year is considered wasteful due to a small mistake I made, I installed the Intel version of VSCode while my MacBook uses the ARM architecture. Of course, at that time, there was a battery drain from 100% to 20% in 2 hours. Very wasteful.\nPerformance Photo from Tekno Cerdas.\nWho would have thought that Apple Silicon could surpass the performance of the latest and strongest Intel processors? According to Techjourneyman, when the Apple Silicon M1 was released, it outperformed the best generation 10 Intel processor (i9-10980HK), forcing Intel to fight back.\nOf course, Intel beat M1 with the release of the i9-11900K, but was completely defeated by the M1 Max and M1 Ultra. In terms of performance and integrated GPU, M1 is far ahead of Intel, who relies on external GPUs like Nvidia.\n\u0026ldquo;With such great performance and power, what about battery usage, is it wasteful?\u0026rdquo; No, because the M1 architecture is ARM-based, focusing on the balance between processor size, lower power consumption, lower heat, speed, and longer battery life. Unlike processors with x86 architecture, which optimize performance but consume a lot of power.\nDisadvantages It\u0026rsquo;s not fair if I only state the advantages of the MacBook while not mentioning its disadvantages. Of course, these things I felt have a significant impact on me:\nA steep learning curve. As a new MacBook user, MacOS has many features that rely on shortcuts if you want to work faster. Moreover, the difference in UI from Windows to MacOS is very different.\nNot modular, once you buy a MacBook, there are no options to upgrade it in terms of storage, RAM, or processor. Yes, all components are soldered to the motherboard.\nWindows applications cannot be installed on MacOS. Although some developers can bring their applications to MacOS, most cannot be installed just like that. The solution is, you can use the web version of the application or install it on a virtual machine like Parallels.\nFeatures that have been available on Windows for a long time are not yet available on MacOS. A feature that I often need on Windows is the volume mixer. A simple software aimed at adjusting the sound of each application is not provided on MacOS. Whether in the development stage, or Apple deliberately does not make it.\nCapitalism at its best. Many paid programs are overpriced, even for extending iCloud storage, we have to pay a subscription. Every Apple built-in feature such as Music, TV, Podcasts is all paid.\nPorts. MacBook releases in 2020 and above, with the 13-inch series, do not have enough ports for everyday needs. Only 2 thunderbolt type C ports are provided by Apple, and there are no other ports. So I have to buy a dongle, which is not cheap either.\nLast words Aside from the luxurious presentation of the Apple logo, there are many advantages to the MacBook that I have experienced. But is the MacBook \u0026ldquo;worth to buy\u0026rdquo;? Honestly, no. Personally, I prefer Linux, with its optimized performance (although complicated), you can get performance comparable to a MacBook or even better by using Linux without spending tens of millions of budgets.\nI can even say that my ASUS X441UV laptop almost reached the performance of the MacBook M1 for basic daily usage when using Arch Linux. So, for those of you who want to buy Apple products, reconsider your budget, okay üò¨.\n","permalink":"https://shiroyuki.dev/article/macbook-fashionable-or-actually-impressive/","summary":"Photo by Ales Nesetril on Unsplash\nThe words of description above are insults thrown at me by my friends and even some of my family members.

Named 4 Reality because there are 4 founders: Kurokami Itsuki, Raihan Ikeda, Karen, and Vyula.\nAlong with the emergence of the 1st Generation 4 Reality, they also conceptualized the Utaite team (which focuses on singing cover content), also consisting of 4 characters: Cyanpile, Aura Lily, Yua Deyanara, and Miasviel.\nThis website was built using:\nVue.js v3 - using compiler Vite v1 TailwindCSS v2 Vercel Development The development of this website is based on my love for one of the Utaite characters, Aura Lily, a beautiful and charming fairy. After exploring the 4 Reality Discord server, I met Karen who also manages all the assets for this team. With the initiative to make Aura Lily a wallpaper, I easily obtained her character design.\nHere is the design for the Aura Lily wallpaper which will then become the 4 Reality website development idea:\nI used to love the concept of the Broken Grid, but the biggest challenge I will face in development is what I call the stylesheet chaos. A condition where there will be many redundant stylesheets and they tend to only be used once for a specific character. Fortunately, I found a CSS framework that can handle this, TailwindCSS.\nOne can imagine how difficult it is to create a character profile page tha contains a lot of information such as:\nTalent name Type of character played Social media Motto Used color palette Additional information After the complex design of Aura Lily was finished, I then thought, \u0026ldquo;What if I develop this website again?\u0026rdquo; See the statement \u0026ldquo;develop again\u0026rdquo;, this statement appeared because the 4 Reality website already existed at that time, but was far from adequate.\nA makeshift Bootstrap 4 template, combined with raw assets that were so large they reached 10MB per image, affecting load time, and a very simple design (due to the template, of course).\nProfile Section Dilemma The next challenge is not about thinking about how to design the website, but about how I can present 8 talents on one page without having to change pages. Vue Dynamic Component was finally used to store each talent\u0026rsquo;s information. So the website visitor simply clicks on the icon of the talent they want to see and the details of that talent will automatically appear.\nHere is the design for the Profile Section:\nHowever, of course, there is information that will not be visible if the design of the Profile Section is in the form of scrolling. There is no information \u0026ldquo;Which part is this talent from? Is he a VTuber or an Utaite? Then what if there is a Generation 2, Generation 3, and so on?\u0026rdquo; Of course, this is a dilemma in itself. I have 2 options:\nDisplay the character information played by the talent in the profile details, with the risk of the design becoming imbalanced due to the addition of the word \u0026ldquo;Gen 1\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Utaite\u0026rdquo; firmly. Categorizing characters based on each talent\u0026rsquo;s role, by creating \u0026ldquo;Tabs\u0026rdquo;. I decided to use option 2, the easiest option to implement and not changing the existing design. Here is the view I took from the direct website.\nAbout the rest of the parts, how is it, Tsu? As context, Tsu here is a nickname from the word Hatsu (Âàù / „ÅØ„Å§). My nickname at the time was HatsuShiroyuki (ÂàùÁôΩÈõ™) - The first Snow White\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a simple question that Karen said when I finished working on the Character Section, a simple question but it took me a lot of brainpower to think about how to design the Home, Vision and Mission, Contact Us, and Footer sections.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really not an easy task, because the first impression I give is the chaotic yet balanced and visually pleasing Broken Grid nuance.\nHome The Home section literally just displays an overview of the entire website. After using my brain power for quite a while only for the Home section, I sent this home section draft to KarenandItsuki`:\nThere was no rejection, but more like a suggestion:\nHow about under 4 Reality Team you add these words, Tsu: \u0026ldquo;Together Everyone Achieves More And There is no I in Team.\u0026rdquo;\n‚Äî Itsuki\nAt the same time, at the top there is a header, and the color should not be too black. Grayish is also okay.\n‚Äî Karen\nChallenge accepted, Ki, Ren. After making some adjustments, here is the design I sent back to them:\nEveryone agreed with the Home Section design, and then moved on to the About Us Section.\nAbout Us This section is also a challenge in itself because we want to display 1 vision and 3 missions, while at the same time telling briefly about their team.\nI came up with an idea where I would use the top sub-section for About the Team, and the bottom sub-section for Vision and Mission. Of course, this design was not well received, and tended to destroy the Broken Grid nuance used:\nOf course, I think you as a reader are equally annoyed \u0026ldquo;why like that?\u0026rdquo;. Technically, it will damage the theme, but how else, the brain is already stuck üíÄ. I take time to rest my brain for a few days, and also to find inspiration for this section.\n2 days have passed, and I sent this design:\nThe concept I created for the About Us Section is as follows:\nThe upper left corner contains \u0026lsquo;V\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;M\u0026rsquo;, which means Vision or Mission. The vision or mission content is not too long. The Card arrangement will be sorted down, not zig-zag on the Tablet display. The About 4 Reality on the left is in a sticky form, so it will automatically scroll down when the user also scrolls down. This is the main reason why the left side looks empty. The design was accepted by all members of 4 Reality, and I immediately merged the existing design and then sliced the design into code.\nSlicing Slicing is the longest stage, thinking about how the display can match each viewport is not an easy thing. Knowledge of responsive web design will be very useful at this stage.\nFor the Home Section, it is relatively easy, it only took a few hours to make it responsive on all viewports.\nThe About Us Section is also relatively easy. Display the Cards in a zig-zag on the right on the Desktop viewport, display it in order from top to bottom on the Tablet viewport, and remove the sticky property on the Mobile viewport.\nThe Character Section is a heavy challenge from all sections.\nI had to build a unique design for each Talent. There are also uniqu requests from some Talents, whether they want a 2-color option, or use a different name direction (check the Aura Lily detail as an example). I had to categorize each Talent into the appropriate section. I had to make sure that all designs can be seen well on all viewports, and again, they must be responsive. The rest of the Contact and Social Media sections are simple sections that are not too good, but still consistent with the color theme used.\nIn conclussion So far in my career in website development, 4 Reality is the most complex website I have ever made. But the result of this hard work is well paid off because the 4 Reality Website became the winner in 2 Wibucode events:\n1st Place Front-end 2021 Wibucode event on June 14, 2021\n2nd Place Tailwind CSS 2021 Wibucode event on December 13, 2021\nA small, proud achievement üò¨.\nThank you to all parties involved in the development of this website. Especially Karen who always gives positive feedback and builds, Itsuki and Nervia (staff) who often provide sharp and spicy criticism, and Aura Lily who is the main motivation behind the development of this website.\n","permalink":"https://shiroyuki.dev/portfolio/website/4reality/","summary":"Overview 4 Reality is a Virtual YouTuber team (often called VTuber) based on Indonesia.
