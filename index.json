[{"content":" Overview 4 Reality is a Virtual YouTuber team (often called VTuber) based on Indonesia. Named 4 Reality because there are 4 founders: Kurokami Itsuki, Raihan Ikeda, Karen, and Vyula.\nAlong with the emergence of the 1st Generation 4 Reality, they also conceptualized the Utaite team (which focuses on singing cover content), also consisting of 4 characters: Cyanpile, Aura Lily, Yua Deyanara, and Miasviel.\nThis website was built using:\nVue.js v3 - using compiler Vite v1 TailwindCSS v2 Vercel Development The development of this website is based on my love for one of the Utaite characters, Aura Lily, a beautiful and charming fairy. After exploring the 4 Reality Discord server, I met Karen who also manages all the assets for this team. With the initiative to make Aura Lily a wallpaper, I easily obtained her character design.\nHere is the design for the Aura Lily wallpaper which will then become the 4 Reality website development idea:\nI used to love the concept of the Broken Grid, but the biggest challenge I will face in development is what I call the stylesheet chaos. A condition where there will be many redundant stylesheets and they tend to only be used once for a specific character. Fortunately, I found a CSS framework that can handle this, TailwindCSS.\nOne can imagine how difficult it is to create a character profile page tha contains a lot of information such as:\nTalent name Type of character played Social media Motto Used color palette Additional information After the complex design of Aura Lily was finished, I then thought, \u0026ldquo;What if I develop this website again?\u0026rdquo; See the statement \u0026ldquo;develop again\u0026rdquo;, this statement appeared because the 4 Reality website already existed at that time, but was far from adequate.\nA makeshift Bootstrap 4 template, combined with raw assets that were so large they reached 10MB per image, affecting load time, and a very simple design (due to the template, of course).\nProfile Section Dilemma The next challenge is not about thinking about how to design the website, but about how I can present 8 talents on one page without having to change pages. Vue Dynamic Component was finally used to store each talent\u0026rsquo;s information. So the website visitor simply clicks on the icon of the talent they want to see and the details of that talent will automatically appear.\nHere is the design for the Profile Section:\nHowever, of course, there is information that will not be visible if the design of the Profile Section is in the form of scrolling. There is no information \u0026ldquo;Which part is this talent from? Is he a VTuber or an Utaite? Then what if there is a Generation 2, Generation 3, and so on?\u0026rdquo; Of course, this is a dilemma in itself. I have 2 options:\nDisplay the character information played by the talent in the profile details, with the risk of the design becoming imbalanced due to the addition of the word \u0026ldquo;Gen 1\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Utaite\u0026rdquo; firmly. Categorizing characters based on each talent\u0026rsquo;s role, by creating \u0026ldquo;Tabs\u0026rdquo;. I decided to use option 2, the easiest option to implement and not changing the existing design. Here is the view I took from the direct website.\nAbout the rest of the parts, how is it, Tsu? As context, Tsu here is a nickname from the word Hatsu (Âàù / „ÅØ„Å§). My nickname at the time was HatsuShiroyuki (ÂàùÁôΩÈõ™) - The first Snow White\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a simple question that Karen said when I finished working on the Character Section, a simple question but it took me a lot of brainpower to think about how to design the Home, Vision and Mission, Contact Us, and Footer sections.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really not an easy task, because the first impression I give is the chaotic yet balanced and visually pleasing Broken Grid nuance.\nHome The Home section literally just displays an overview of the entire website. After using my brain power for quite a while only for the Home section, I sent this home section draft to KarenandItsuki`:\nThere was no rejection, but more like a suggestion:\nHow about under 4 Reality Team you add these words, Tsu: \u0026ldquo;Together Everyone Achieves More And There is no I in Team.\u0026rdquo;\n‚Äî Itsuki\nAt the same time, at the top there is a header, and the color should not be too black. Grayish is also okay.\n‚Äî Karen\nChallenge accepted, Ki, Ren. After making some adjustments, here is the design I sent back to them:\nEveryone agreed with the Home Section design, and then moved on to the About Us Section.\nAbout Us This section is also a challenge in itself because we want to display 1 vision and 3 missions, while at the same time telling briefly about their team.\nI came up with an idea where I would use the top sub-section for About the Team, and the bottom sub-section for Vision and Mission. Of course, this design was not well received, and tended to destroy the Broken Grid nuance used:\nOf course, I think you as a reader are equally annoyed \u0026ldquo;why like that?\u0026rdquo;. Technically, it will damage the theme, but how else, the brain is already stuck üíÄ. I take time to rest my brain for a few days, and also to find inspiration for this section.\n2 days have passed, and I sent this design:\nThe concept I created for the About Us Section is as follows:\nThe upper left corner contains \u0026lsquo;V\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;M\u0026rsquo;, which means Vision or Mission. The vision or mission content is not too long. The Card arrangement will be sorted down, not zig-zag on the Tablet display. The About 4 Reality on the left is in a sticky form, so it will automatically scroll down when the user also scrolls down. This is the main reason why the left side looks empty. The design was accepted by all members of 4 Reality, and I immediately merged the existing design and then sliced the design into code.\nSlicing Slicing is the longest stage, thinking about how the display can match each viewport is not an easy thing. Knowledge of responsive web design will be very useful at this stage.\nFor the Home Section, it is relatively easy, it only took a few hours to make it responsive on all viewports.\nThe About Us Section is also relatively easy. Display the Cards in a zig-zag on the right on the Desktop viewport, display it in order from top to bottom on the Tablet viewport, and remove the sticky property on the Mobile viewport.\nThe Character Section is a heavy challenge from all sections.\nI had to build a unique design for each Talent. There are also uniqu requests from some Talents, whether they want a 2-color option, or use a different name direction (check the Aura Lily detail as an example). I had to categorize each Talent into the appropriate section. I had to make sure that all designs can be seen well on all viewports, and again, they must be responsive. The rest of the Contact and Social Media sections are simple sections that are not too good, but still consistent with the color theme used.\nIn conclussion So far in my career in website development, 4 Reality is the most complex website I have ever made. But the result of this hard work is well paid off because the 4 Reality Website became the winner in 2 Wibucode events:\n1st Place Front-end 2021 Wibucode event on June 14, 2021\n2nd Place Tailwind CSS 2021 Wibucode event on December 13, 2021\nA small, proud achievement üò¨.\nThank you to all parties involved in the development of this website. Especially Karen who always gives positive feedback and builds, Itsuki and Nervia (staff) who often provide sharp and spicy criticism, and Aura Lily who is the main motivation behind the development of this website.\n","permalink":"https://shiroyuki.dev/portfolio/website/4reality/","summary":"Overview 4 Reality is a Virtual YouTuber team (often called VTuber) based on Indonesia.
